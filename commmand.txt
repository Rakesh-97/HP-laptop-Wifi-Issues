Firsty open the Tetminal in Linux os than type following command -
" sudo modprobe -rv rtl8723be " (without ")

Then enter this command line also-
" sudo modprobe -v rtl8723be ant_sel=1 " (without ")

Then check your laptop wifi signals
Enjoy !!

If You want to run these command on every boot then enter following command also.This will create a config file to make the setting permanent 
" sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf <<< "options rtl8723be ant_sel=1" " (without ")

Thank you.!
